TODOS:

    


    - infrastructure to support scene loading as we progress through levels
    - enemy death animation

DONE: 
    - end screen when player health reaches zero (or lives?)
    - randomly have some enemies not move

    - pack wolf scene so it can be instantiated
    - catch all if player(s) 'fall' off controllable area

    - randomly spawn wolves
    - enemy health display
    - player damage on enemy
    - bullet script
